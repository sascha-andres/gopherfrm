Frankfurt Rhein-Main Gophers Meetup is organized by Anna-Katharina Wickert, Arne Hormann and Sascha Andres.

## Anna-Katharina Wickert

Reactived #gofrm in 2017 and build up the awesome #gofrm community as an organizer ❤

## Arne Hormann

Arne is not a dogmatic, but Go is by far his favorite language. He especially loves the tools and the pragmatism and engineering behind it. After converting his coworkers, he can even use it at work.

## Sascha Andres

Loves computer languages in general is was inspired by the book "The Laws of Simplicity" written by John Maeda. Go just fits and became his go-to language.
