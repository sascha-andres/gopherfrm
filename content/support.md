Organizing a meetup is fun. Working together on making a meetup a success is even more fun.
While it is fun it takes some resources to keep a meetup group running. Therefore we are very thankful for all speakers and companies providing us with space to meet.

If you want to support us you can do this by hosting, giving a talk or supporting us with stuff for small raffles or helping us keeping the infrastructure up and running.

If you have a talk please fill in the [form for upcoming speaker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15hJf4tvC5mKoXtPY7erxmnMbGyKw42wPjOyTlYbFXSI/viewform).
